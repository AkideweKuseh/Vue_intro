My First Vue Project

Vue Product Page
This is a simple Vue.js application that demonstrates various Vue concepts learned from the introductory course on VueMastery.com. The application is a product page that displays product details, allows users to add products to a cart, and shows product reviews.
Features

Display Product Details: The page shows detailed information about a product, including its name, description, price, and image.

Add to Cart: Users can add the product to a cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.

Product Reviews: The page displays a list of reviews for the product.

Form Handling: Users can submit a new review using a form, which is handled by Vue's v-model directive.

Concepts Covered
This project covers the following Vue.js concepts:

Vue CDN: The Vue library is included using the Vue CDN.

Vue Instance: The Vue instance is created and mounted to the HTML element with the ID #app.

Attribute Binding: The v-bind directive is used to bind data properties to HTML attributes.

Conditional Rendering: The v-if, v-else, and v-show directives are used for conditional rendering.

List Rendering: The v-for directive is used to render a list of items (e.g., product reviews).

Event Handling: The v-on directive (or its shorthand @) is used to handle events, such as clicks and mouse movements.

Class & Style Binding: The :class and :style bindings are used to dynamically apply CSS classes and styles.

Computed Properties: Computed properties are used to perform calculations or transformations on data properties.

Components and Props: The application is structured using Vue components, and data is passed between components using props.

Event Communication: Components communicate with each other using custom events.

Forms and v-model: The v-model directive is used for two-way data binding in forms
